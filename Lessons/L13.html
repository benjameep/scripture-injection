<h4>A Pattern for Preparing for the Second Coming</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon was uniquely written to help us in our day to prepare for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. President Ezra Taft Benson (1899&#x2013;1994) taught the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;In </span><span>the Book of Mormon we find a pattern for preparing for the Second Coming. A major portion of the book centers on the few decades just prior to Christ&#x2019;s coming to America. By careful study of that time period, we can determine why some were destroyed in the terrible judgments that preceded His coming and what brought others to stand at the temple in the land of Bountiful and thrust their hands into the wounds of His hands and feet</span><span>&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-ezra-taft-benson/chapter-10-flooding-the-earth-and-our-lives-with-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng"><span>Teachings of presidents of the Church&#x2014;Ezra Taft Benson</span></a><span>, p.140).</span></p>
<p><span>The disciples of Christ in the Book of Mormon resisted the evils of their day and remained faithful as they waited for the fulfillment of the prophesies of the coming of the Savior.</span></p>
<p><span>As we follow the guidance of prophets in our day, we will be prepared to watch </span><span>for the signs of the Savior&apos;s </span><span>Second Coming and be prepared to meet Him.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The wickedness among the Nephites prior to the Savior&#x2019;s visit parallels the wickedness of our day.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Mormon recounts that the </span><span>Nephite world was fraught with much </span><span>contention and discord&#xA0;</span><span>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/1.1-13#p1" target="_blank">Helaman&#xA0;</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/1.1-13#p1" target="_blank">1:1&#x2013;13</a>;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</p>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li><span>Mormon describes how secret combinations infest the land and eventually overthrow the Nephite government (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.11-12#p11" target="_blank">3 </a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</p></div><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.11-12#p11" target="_blank"><span>Nephi&#xA0;</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.11-12#p11" target="_blank">2:11&#x2013;12</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.1-14#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 7:1&#x2013;14</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes became exceedingly great.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because of the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</p>

</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Though surrounded by wickedness, the followers of Christ overcome the world.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Through the preaching and miracles of Nephi, many people repent, are converted, witness miracles, and remain faithful followers of Christ. (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.15-26#p15" target="_blank">3 Nephi 7:15-26</a>)</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi&#x2014;having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds&#x2014;went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Prophets testify of Christ&#x2019;s coming and teach how to prepare for it.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Samuel the Lamanite prophesies of the signs and wonders that will occur at the birth and death of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.1-31#p1" target="_blank">Helaman 14:1&#x2013;31</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</p></div>
<li><span>Nephi and members of Christ&#x2019;s Church are persecuted for their beliefs&#xA0; but continue to watch for the signs of Christ&#x2019;s birth (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.4-20#p4" target="_blank">3 Nephi&#xA0;</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</p>

<p><strong>13 </strong>Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son&#x2014;of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.

<p><strong>5 </strong>But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</p>

<p><strong>2 </strong>But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies. And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>3 </strong>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</p>

<p><strong>5 </strong>O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his wicked ways.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</p>

<h4><span>The Attributes of Zion</span></h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon teaches the principles and patterns for establishing </span><span>Z</span><span>ion. The </span><span>Prophet Joseph Smith </span><span>taught that &quot;</span><span>The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day; but they died without the sight; we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-15?lang=eng"><span>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph </span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-15?lang=eng">Smith</a>,</span><span>&#xA0;</span><span>186).</span></p>
<p><span>The people of God have always sought to establish Zion, a people of righteousness, unity, and love. The prophets of the Book of Mormon repeatedly taught their people to be obedient, to love others, and to care for the poor and needy. Throughout their history, the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> experienced times of peace, unity, and righteousness, but each of these episodes were eventually followed by pride, contention, wickedness, and war.</span></p>
<p><span>As we prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the Book of Mormon teaches us how we can establish Zion despite the wickedness of the world around us. Like the righteous </span><span>Nephites</span><span>, we can remain steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments, caring for the poor and needy, and being filled with love towards God and towards all men.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches about the unity, love, and discipleship that characterize Zion.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Mormon recounts the prosperity, unity, and love of those who are converted unto the Lord following the ministry of Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.1-18#p1" target="_blank">4 Nephi 1:1&#x2013;18</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed away also, and there still continued to be peace in the land.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and raise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And thus did the thirty and eighth year pass away, and also the thirty and ninth, and forty and first, and the forty and second, yea, even until forty and nine years had passed away, and also the fifty and first, and the fifty and second; yea, and even until fifty and nine years had passed away.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea, insomuch that they did build cities again where there had been cities burned.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Yea, even that great city Zarahemla did they cause to be built again.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>But there were many cities which had been sunk, and waters came up in the stead thereof; therefore these cities could not be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now, behold, it came to pass that the people of Nephi did wax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an exceedingly fair and delightsome people.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And they were married, and given in marriage, and were blessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord had made unto them.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And they did not walk any more after the performances and ordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that the seventy and first year passed away, and also the seventy and second year, yea, and in fine, till the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years had passed away, and the disciples of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to the paradise of God, save it were the three who should tarry; and there were other disciples ordained in their stead; and also many of that generation had passed away.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until an hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there was no contention in all the land.</p></div>
<li>Alma the elder organizes the Church and commands the people to have no contention and to be one (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.17-30#p17" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:17&#x2013;30</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>17 </strong>And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the children of God.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.</p></div>
<li><span>During a time of persecution, the faithful </span><span>Nephites</span><span> remained steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments and caring for the poor and needy (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.25-33#p25" target="_blank">Alma 1:25&#x2013;33</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>25 </strong>Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need&#x2014;an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</p></div></li>

And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And all those who were with me did take upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things, according to the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who were called my people.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon&#x2019;s temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my power.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my people.</p>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.</p>

<p><strong>19 </strong>And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>22 </strong>And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</p>

<li><span>King Benjamin teaches his people how </span><span>to be covenant disciples and care for the poor and needy&#xA0;</span><span>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.1-30#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 4:1&#x2013;30</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you&#x2014;that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God&#x2014;I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>26 </strong>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</p>

<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And he breathed out many threatenings against them. And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.</p></div></li>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon shows the forces that Satan uses to destroy Zion.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Mormon recounts the pride and wickedness that ultimately destroys the Zion-like civilization of the </span><span>Nephites</span><span>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.19-49#p19" target="_blank">4 Nephi 1:19&#x2013;49</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last record, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his stead; and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still peace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the land.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and it was an hundred and ninety and four years from the coming of Christ) and his son Amos kept the record in his stead; and he also kept it upon the plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of Nephi, which is this book.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it came to pass that two hundred years had passed away; and the second generation had all passed away save it were a few.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know that the people had multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face of the land, and that they had become exceedingly rich, because of their prosperity in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now, in this two hundred and first year there began to be among them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine things of the world.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substance no more common among them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had passed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden because of unworthiness.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity, and because of the power of Satan who did get hold upon their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And again, there was another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true church of Christ, because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast them into prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth doing mighty miracles among them.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his word.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And they did cast them into furnaces of fire, and they came forth receiving no harm.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts, and they did play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and they did come forth from among them, receiving no harm.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they were led by many priests and false prophets to build up many churches, and to do all manner of iniquity. And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had passed away.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the two hundred and thirty and first year, there was a great division among the people.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And it came to pass that in this year there arose a people who were called the Nephites, and they were true believers in Christ; and among them there were those who were called by the Lamanites&#x2014;Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites;</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>Therefore the true believers in Christ, and the true worshipers of Christ, (among whom were the three disciples of Jesus who should tarry) were called Nephites, and Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle in unbelief, but they did wilfully rebel against the gospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning, did dwindle.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their fathers, even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught to hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to hate the children of Nephi from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And it came to pass that two hundred and forty and four years had passed away, and thus were the affairs of the people. And the more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became exceedingly more numerous than were the people of God.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And they did still continue to build up churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began again to build up the secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began to be proud in their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, and become vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>44 </strong>And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><strong>45 </strong>And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed away, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another.</p>
<p><strong>46 </strong>And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner of traffic.</p>
<p><strong>47 </strong>And it came to pass that after three hundred and five years had passed away, (and the people did still remain in wickedness) Amos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead.</p>
<p><strong>48 </strong>And it came to pass that when three hundred and twenty years had passed away, Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred&#x2014;yea, even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred&#x2014;even until the three hundred and twentieth year from the coming of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>49 </strong>And he did hide them up unto the Lord, that they might come again unto the remnant of the house of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the record of Ammaron.</p></div></li>
<li><span>After defeating the </span><span>Gadianton</span><span> robbers and a period of righteousness, the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> willfully rebel against God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.4-18#p4" target="_blank">3 Nephi 6:4&#x2013;18</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this&#x2014;Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year&#x2014;the people having been delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should&#x2014;and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.</p></div></li>
