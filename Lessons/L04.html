<h3>Creation, Fall of Adam and Eve, and the Natural Man</h3>

<h4>Creation, Fall of Adam and Eve, and the Natural Man</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon contains &quot;the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ&quot; and teaches the great &quot;plan of redemption&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.25#p25" target="_blank">Alma 12:25</a>). Throughout its pages, the Book of Mormon confirms that Jesus Christ is the creator of the world and that part of His atoning mission was to save all men from the spiritual and physical death brought about by the Fall.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>25 </strong>Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.</p></div></p>
<p><span>The Fall of Adam and Eve is perhaps one of the most misunderstood doctrines of Christianity, but it is also one of the doctrines that we must understand to fully appreciate why we need a Savior. President Ezra Taft Benson taught: &quot;Just as a man does not really desire food until he is hungry, so he does not desire the salvation of Christ until he knows why he needs Christ. </span></p>
<p><span>&quot;No one adequately and properly knows why he needs Christ until he understands and accepts the doctrine of the Fall and its effect upon all mankind. And no other book in the world explains this vital doctrine nearly as well as the Book of Mormon&quot;</span><span> </span><span>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1987/04/the-book-of-mormon-and-the-doctrine-and-covenants?lang=eng"><em>The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants</em></a>, Ensign, May 1987, 85)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon teaches that the Fall of Adam was part of the great plan of happiness. It teaches that the Lord mercifully extended the lives of Adam and Eve and enabled them to have children so that in time a Savior, the son of God, could come to make an Atonement that would overcome all of the effects of the Fall of Adam.</span></p>

<li>When&#xA0;Ammon taught King Lamoni, he started with the Creation to help Lamoni understand the plan (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.34-36#p34" target="_blank">Alma 18:34&#x2013;36</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>34 </strong>Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.</p></div>
<li>Aaron teaches King Lamoni&#x2019;s father from the scriptures that man was created in the image of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.12#p12" target="_blank">Alma 22:12</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king&#x2014;how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</p></div>
<li>The Savior teaches the Brother of Jared that man was created in the image of the Lord&#xA0; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.15-16#p15" target="_blank">Ether 3:15&#x2013;16</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>15 </strong>And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</p></div>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon gives <g class="gr_ gr_65 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="65" data-gr-id="65">the most complete</g> explanation of the need for the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Nephi teaches that all are in a lost and fallen state and need a Redeemer (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.4-6#p4" target="_blank">1 Nephi 10:4&#x2013;6</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews&#x2014;even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number had testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom he had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.</p></div>
<li><span>Lehi</span><span> teaches his son Jacob the eternal significance of the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.4-30#p4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:4&#x2013;30</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose that an angel of God, according to that which is written, had fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil, having sought that which was evil before God.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit;</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Alma </span><span>teaches the people of </span><span>Ammonihah</span><span> regarding a</span><span>&#xA0;misunderstanding </span><span>of the Fall of Adam and man&#x2019;s redemption (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.21-34#p21" target="_blank">Alma 12:21&#x2013;34</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>21 </strong>What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li><span>Alma teaches his son </span><span>Corianton</span><span> </span><span>concerning the Fall of Adam and God&#x2019;s justice and mercy towards fallen man (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.1-14#p1" target="_blank">Alma 42:1&#x2013;14</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand&#x2014;which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken&#x2014;yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>But behold, it was appointed unto man to die&#x2014;therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth&#x2014;and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li>
<div><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that because of the Fall, all mankind is in a lost and fallen state and are subject to both physical and spiritual death.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Abinadi teaches the effect of the Fall on mankind, who become lost, fallen, carnal, and devilish (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.1-12#p1" target="_blank"><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Mosiah</span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;"> 16:1&#x2013;12</span></a><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">).</span></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall confess before God that his judgments are just.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.</p></div>
<li>The Fall results in man becoming a fallen and natural man (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19#p19" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p></div>
<li>Alma teaches that physical and spiritual death are a result of the&#xA0;Fall (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.16-24#p16" target="_blank">Alma 12:16&#x2013;24</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>16 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God&#x2019;s justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die?</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</p></div>
<li>Jacob teaches the Nephites what would occur if there were no Atonement and all mankind were subject to the Fall (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-12#p6" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:6&#x2013;12</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement&#x2014;save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</p></div>
