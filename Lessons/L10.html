<h3>Obedience to God&apos;s Prophets and Commandments</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Obedience to God&apos;s Prophets and Commandments</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction<br></strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon was &quot;written by way of commandment&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title page</a>), and like the brass plates which Nephi obtained, it &quot;</span><div class="callout"></div><span>testif</span><span>[</span><span>ies</span><span>] that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.30#p30" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 22:30</a>). One of the consistent messages throughout the Book of Mormon is that obedience to God and His prophets leads to happiness and eternal life, whereas rejecting God and His prophets leads to misery and destruction.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>30 </strong>Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the things which have been written upon the plates of brass are true; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God.</p></div></p>
<p><span>Obedience to God is not a popular virtue in the world today. People regularly seek to excuse or rationalize their sins. Moral relativism, the belief that right and wrong is solely determined by individuals, is gaining in popularity. Nephi recorded Isaiah&#x2019;s prophesy that in the&#xA0;latter days people would &quot;call evil good, and good evil&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.20#p20" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 15:20</a>). President Thomas S. Monson observed that &quot;where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and it&#x2019;s growing ever wider&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/priesthood-power?lang=eng" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Priesthood Power</a>, Ensign, May 2011).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</p></div></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon teaches the commandments of God. It affirms that the Ten Commandments are still commandments! It warns against dishonesty, immorality, and murder. It testifies that following God&#x2019;s prophets and keeping His commandments will keep you spiritually safe. As you study the Book of Mormon prayerfully, it will strengthen you to keep the commandments of God, to discern between right and wrong, and to do what is right despite any opposition or persecution you may face.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon demonstrates that breaking God&#x2019;s commandments and rejecting his prophets leads to bondage and destruction.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Nephi recounts how Lehi testified to the people of Jerusalem concerning their wickedness and how they sought to take his life (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.18-20#p18" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 1:18&#x2013;20</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li>Nephi teaches that no nation is destroyed without warning from God&#x2019;s prophets (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.9#p9" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 25:9</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.</p></div>
<li><span>Abinadi</span><span> prophesies that King Noah&#x2019;s people would be brought into bondage and the people hardened their hearts against him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11.20-29#p20" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 11:20&#x2013;29</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.1-17#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12:1&#x2013;17</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and began to prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me, saying&#x2014;Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to pass that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be smitten on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and I will cause that they shall howl all the day long.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon their backs; and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten with the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and devour their grain.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And they shall be smitten with a great pestilence&#x2014;and all this will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other nations. And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took him and carried him bound before the king, and said unto the king: Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will destroy them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and trodden under foot.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land. And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what great sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned of God or judged of this man?</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king, hast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and he has prophesied in vain.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord&#x2014;Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my people.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him. And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Samuel the Lamanite teaches the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> that they will be cursed and destroyed for rejecting the prophets and breaking the commandments (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.22-39#p22" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Helaman</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.22-39#p22" target="_blank"> 13:22&#x2013;39</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because of your iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and cast them out.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth&#x2014;and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you? Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye lament, and say:</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in those days.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words! And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.</p></div></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.</p>

<li><span>The </span><span>Jaredites</span><span> are cursed for rejecting the prophets and it is foretold that they will be destroyed because of their disobedience (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/11.1-23#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ether 11:1&#x2013;23</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And there came also in the days of Com many prophets, and prophesied of the destruction of that great people except they should repent, and turn unto the Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the people, and they fled unto Com for protection, for the people sought to destroy them.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And they prophesied unto Com many things; and he was blessed in all the remainder of his days.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And he lived to a good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned in his stead. And the brother of Shiblom rebelled against him, and there began to be an exceedingly great war in all the land.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom caused that all the prophets who prophesied of the destruction of the people should be put to death;</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had testified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon the face of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of their wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and contentions in all the land, and also many famines and pestilences, insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all this came to pass in the days of Shiblom.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And the people began to repent of their iniquity; and inasmuch as they did the Lord did have mercy on them.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that Shiblom was slain, and Seth was brought into captivity, and did dwell in captivity all his days.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the kingdom; and he did reign over the people all his days. And he did do all manner of iniquity in his days, by which he did cause the shedding of much blood; and few were his days.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom; and he also did do that which was wicked in his days.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem there came many prophets, and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth except they repented of their iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts, and would not hearken unto their words; and the prophets mourned and withdrew from among the people.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in wickedness all his days; and he begat Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did reign in his stead; and Moron did that which was wicked before the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the people, because of that secret combination which was built up to get power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did obtain the kingdom again.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and he was a descendant of the brother of Jared.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain the kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in captivity all the remainder of his days; and he begat Coriantor.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his days.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And in the days of Coriantor there also came many prophets, and prophesied of great and marvelous things, and cried repentance unto the people, and except they should repent the Lord God would execute judgment against them to their utter destruction;</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And that the Lord God would send or bring forth another people to possess the land, by his power, after the manner by which he brought their fathers.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And they did reject all the words of the prophets, because of their secret society and wicked abominations.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died, having dwelt in captivity all his days.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>17 </strong>And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the Lamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the army of Aaron have fallen victims to their awful brutality.</p>

<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Abinadi rebukes the priests of King Noah for breaking the Ten Commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12.25#p25" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 12: 25</a>,<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.1-35#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mosiah 13: 1&#x2013;35</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now when the king had heard these words, he said unto his priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to do with him, for he is mad.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto them:</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me. And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with exceeding luster, even as Moses&#x2019; did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he spake with power and authority from God; and he continued his words, saying:</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore I finish my message. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts because I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with anger.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But this much I tell you, what you do with me, after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part of your lives.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which are in the water under the earth.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Thou shalt not kill.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor&#x2019;s.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of these sayings that he said unto them: Have ye taught this people that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these commandments?</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people? Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began&#x2014;have they not spoken more or less concerning these things?</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Have they not said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be oppressed and afflicted?</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>25 </strong>And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?</p></div></li>
<li>Alma the elder establishes the Church of Christ and gives commandments for the operation of the church and for individual lives (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.17-29#p17" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 18:17&#x2013;29</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>17 </strong>And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the children of God.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</p></div>

And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</p></div>

<p><strong>4 </strong>Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.</p></div>

<p><strong>9 </strong>Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</p>

<li>Nephi teaches his brothers that he could do all things if God commanded him to do them (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.50-55#p50" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 17:50&#x2013;55</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>50 </strong>And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them.

<p><strong>51 </strong>And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?</p>
<p><strong>52 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not contend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days.

<p><strong>21 </strong>Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.</p>

<p><strong>23 </strong>And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.</p>

<p><strong>26 </strong>And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain.

<p><strong>25 </strong>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done. As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom&#x2019;s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p></div>
<li>Alma commends his son Shiblon for his steadiness and faithfulness in keeping the commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.1-3#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 38:1&#x2013;3</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</p></div>
<li>Abinadi declares that the prophets and those who have hearkened to their words are heirs of the kingdom of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.10-18#p10" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 15:10&#x2013;18</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord&#x2014;I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions. And now, are they not his seed?</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that they are his seed.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;</p></div>
