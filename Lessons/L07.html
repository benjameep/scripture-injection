<h3>The Doctrine of Christ: Baptism, the Sacrament, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost</h3>
<hr>
<h4>The Doctrine of Christ: Baptism &amp; the Sacrament</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon teaches the &quot;fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ,&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9#p9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:9</a>) and was written to restore &quot;plain and precious truths which have been taken away from [the bible]&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.40#p40" target="_blank">1 Nephi 13:40</a>). Baptism is the first ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Book of Mormon restores plain and precious truths regarding baptism and the sacrament.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>40 </strong>And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</p></div></p>
<p><span>During the&#xA0;Apostasy, </span><span>sacred </span><span>truths regarding the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ were lost. Fundamental questions over how to baptize, who could be baptized, and whether baptism was essential for salvation were debated and argued. The meaning and purpose of the ordinance of the sacrament and other doctrinal differences led to schisms, fractures, and splinter groups in the Christian world</span><span>. The restoration of the church began with the coming forth of the </span><span>Book of Mormon </span><span>which answers many </span><span>questions pertaining to these ordinances of the </span><span>gospel </span><span>in plainness and simplicity</span><span>. It affirms that baptism is a saving ordinance which has been required as part of the gospel of Jesus Christ from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span>During the Savior&#x2019;s personal ministry among the </span><span>Nephites</span><span>, he announced the fulfillment of the Law of Moses and instituted baptism and the sacrament as two of the essential ordinances of the higher </span><span>law. Ordinances unlock the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in our lives. As you strive to keep the covenants that you have made in the waters of baptism and in the sacrament each week, you can be forgiven of your sins and receive the blessings of the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>

<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that baptism is essential for our salvation.</strong></li>

<li><span>The Savior teaches the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> the correct manner of baptism and commands that there be no disputations regarding this ordinance (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.18-41#p18" target="_blank">3 Nephi </a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>40 </strong>And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.18-41#p18" target="_blank">11:18&#x2013;41</a>)</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</p>

<li><span>The Savior teaches </span><span>the twelve disciples the commandments of repentance and baptism&#xA0;</span><span>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16-21#p16" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:16&#x2013;21</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>16 </strong>And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do;</p></div></li>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches the qualifications and covenant responsibilities of those who are baptized.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Alma </span><span>the elder </span><span>teaches his people the covenant responsibilities of those who are baptized (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.1-16#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king. And many did believe his words.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, that they may be light;</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.1-16#p1" target="_blank">1&#x2013;16</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi&#x2014;</p>

<p><strong>15 </strong>Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</p>

<li>Jesus institutes the sacrament among the Nephites, and invites them to remember His body and blood that was sacrificed for them (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.1-14#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 18:1&#x2013;14</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that they should bring forth some bread and wine unto him.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And while they were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And when the disciples had come with bread and wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed it; and he gave unto the disciples and commanded that they should eat.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And when they had eaten and were filled, he commanded that they should give unto the multitude.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass that when he said these words, he commanded his disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude that they might drink of it.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it and were filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did drink, and they were filled.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And when the disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.</p></div>
<li>Jesus again administers the sacrament among the Nephites, miraculously providing bread and wine (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.1-9#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 20:1&#x2013;9</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they should cease to pray, and also his disciples.

<p><strong>3 </strong>And it came to pass that he brake bread again and blessed it, and gave to the disciples to eat.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And when they had eaten he commanded them that they should break bread, and give unto the multitude.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And when they had given unto the multitude he also gave them wine to drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the multitude.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now, there had been no bread, neither wine, brought by the disciples, neither by the multitude;</p>

<p><strong>8 </strong>And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled.</p>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Book of Mormon teaches that little children are alive in Christ and do not need baptism until they are accountable before God.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Mormon teaches his son Moroni why the baptism of little children is a false practice (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.5-26#p5" target="_blank">Moroni 8:5&#x2013;26</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your little children.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done away in me.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach&#x2014;repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of salvation.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of his mercy.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the power of his redemption.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead works.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance is unto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a broken law.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">We must be sufficiently worthily to partake of the sacrament.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Jesus teaches the disciples not to let anyone partake of the sacrament unworthily (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.28-32#p28" target="_blank">3 Nephi 18:28&#x2013;32</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>28 </strong>And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</p></div>
<li>Moroni teaches those of the latter days to do all things in worthiness (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.29#p29" target="_blank">Mormon 9:29</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>29 </strong>See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out.</p></div>

<h4>The Gift of the Holy Ghost and Enduring to the End</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>As part of the &quot;fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ,&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9#p9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:9</a>) the Book of Mormon teaches that we must receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and endure to the end in order to be saved. As Nephi testified &quot;unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of God, he cannot be saved&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.16#p16" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:16</a>).&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>16 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</p></div></p>
<p><span>In our world today many people feel discouraged, lost, or hopeless. They wonder whether they can have a happy marriage, be a good parent, or handle the relentless temptations of the world. The Savior has provided us with all the spiritual blessings and gifts we need in order to overcome the world and its challenges. He has provided us with the gift of the Holy Ghost, or the blessing of being influenced, guided, and blessed by a member of the Godhead.</span></p>
<p><span>Some wonder why they really need the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Book of Mormon teaches that it is through the Holy Ghost that we can be baptized with fire and receive a remission of our sins. This sanctifying gift is essential to standing spotless before God at the last day. Through the gift of the Holy Ghost we can also receive spiritual gifts, including receiving guidance and direction in our lives. The gift of the Holy Ghost helps us to endure to the end.</span></p>
<p><span>As you prayerfully seek the guidance and companionship of the Holy Ghost and remain worthy of its influence, &quot;it will show unto you all things what ye should do&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5#p5" target="_blank">2 Nephi 32:5</a>). The comfort, peace, faith, and strength you can receive from the Spirit can help you to overcome all of the trials of your life. As you keep your covenants, you can always have the Spirit with you to teach you how to follow Jesus Christ and obtain eternal life.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</p></div></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that the Holy Ghost is a member of the Godhead and a witness of the Father and the Son.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>In Nephi&#x2019;s discourse on the doctrine of Christ, he teaches that the Holy Ghost is a witness of the Father and&#xA0; the Son (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.18,21#p18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 31:18, 21</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.</p></div>
<li>After Jesus teaches the Nephites the manner of baptism, he teaches that the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are one (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.27,32-36#p27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Nephi 11:27, 32&#x2013;36</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>27 </strong>And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</p></div>
<li>Jesus teaches the Nephites that the Holy Ghost witnesses of the Father and the Son (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16.6#p6" target="_blank">3 Nephi 16:6</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses unto them of me and of the Father.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Those who receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost are sanctified by the spirit or baptized by fire.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>The voice of the Savior comes to the Nephites and invites them to offer a broken heart and a contrite spirit so they can be baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20#p20" target="_blank">3 Nephi 9:20</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.</p></div>
<li>The Savior teaches the Nephites that baptism by fire follows the baptism of water (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.1-2#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 12:1&#x2013;2</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of them who had been called, and received power and authority to baptize, was twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye have seen me and know that I am.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.</p></div>
<li>The twelve disciples desire and pray for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, and the Savior prays that the disciples may receive the Holy Ghost and be one with Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19.9-29#p9" target="_blank">3 Nephi 19:9&#x2013;29</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water&#x2019;s edge, and the multitude followed them.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and was baptized.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And he came up out of the water and began to baptize. And he baptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come up out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and commanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they believe in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not cease to pray.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and bowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.</p></div>
<li>Jesus teaches His twelve disciples that we can be sanctified by receiving the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19-20#p19" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:19&#x2013;20</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p></div>
</ol>
<li>
<div><strong>Through the gift of the Holy Ghost we can receive revelation and spiritual gifts.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephi teaches that we can speak by the power of the Holy Ghost and receive revelation through the Spirit (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13#p13" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:13</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.1-6#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 32:1&#x2013;6</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</p></div></li>
<li>In his final message, Moroni teaches that the gifts of the Spirit come according to our faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.7-18#p7" target="_blank">Moroni 10:7&#x2013;18</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom;</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And to another, exceedingly great faith; and to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles;</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And again, to another, all kinds of tongues;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of divers kinds of tongues.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as he will.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh of Christ.</p></div>

<li>Nephi teaches that the brass plates testify that we must be obedient and endure to the end in order to be saved (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.31#p31" target="_blank">1 Nephi 22:31</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>31 </strong>Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them.

<li>Nephi teaches the doctrine of Christ and emphasizes that the Gift of the Holy Ghost helps us to endure to the end (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13-20#p13" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:13&#x2013;20</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism&#x2014;yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?

<p><strong>20 </strong>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.
