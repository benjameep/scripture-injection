<h3>Exposing the Enemies of Christ</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Exposing the Enemies of Christ</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>President Ezra Taft Benson taught that the Book of Mormon helps us come unto Christ by teaching His gospel and revealing those who oppose Christ. He explained, &quot;The </span><span>Book of Mormon exposes the enemies of Christ. It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention</span><span>. </span><span>It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are </span><span>similar to </span><span>the type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and philosophical concepts of our time&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/01/the-book-of-mormon-is-the-word-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Book of Mormon is the Word of God</a>, Ensign, January 1988).</span></p>
<p><span>We are inundated each day through the internet, television, and social media with the philosophies and sophistry of the world. The Book of Mormon can help us see through the mists of darkness and focus on the Savior. It can help us to recognize the adversaries tactics to deceive, distract, and destroy us.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches how false prophets known as antichrists seek to destroy people&#x2019;s faith in the Savior.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Sherem</span><span> teaches that salvation comes by living the Law of Moses and rejects the need for the Savior (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.1-27#p1" target="_blank">Jacob 7:1&#x2013;27</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery, and much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come. And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul, insomuch that I did confound him in all his words.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he said, Yea.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this is not all&#x2014;it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil. Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many days.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people before I shall die.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the devil. And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal punishment.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that when he had said these words he could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was restored again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked man.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates. And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.</p></div></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nehor</span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;"> teaches that all mankind will be saved and that priests and teachers ought to become popular (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.1-33#p1" target="_blank">Alma 1:1&#x2013;33</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pled for himself with much boldness.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious death.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto death.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need&#x2014;an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Korihor</span><span> teaches that there will be no Christ, and ultimately that there is no God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.6-60#p6" target="_blank">Alma 30:6&#x2013;60</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Now there was no law against a man&#x2019;s belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also punished; and if he committed adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness they were punished.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man&#x2019;s belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no man can know of anything which is to come.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms&#x2014;telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest over that people.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Now the high priest&#x2019;s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God&#x2014;a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And Korihor answered him, Yea.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And he answered, Nay.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.</p>
<p><strong>44 </strong>But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</p>
<p><strong>45 </strong>And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.</p>
<p><strong>46 </strong>And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>47 </strong>But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</p>
<p><strong>48 </strong>Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.</p>
<p><strong>49 </strong>Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.</p>
<p><strong>50 </strong>Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.</p>
<p><strong>51 </strong>And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?</p>
<p><strong>52 </strong>And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.</p>
<p><strong>53 </strong>But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.</p>
<p><strong>54 </strong>Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him.</p>
<p><strong>55 </strong>But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.</p>
<p><strong>56 </strong>And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.</p>
<p><strong>57 </strong>Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.</p>
<p><strong>58 </strong>And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.</p>
<p><strong>59 </strong>And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram&#x2014;and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>60 </strong>And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>2 </strong>Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>2 </strong>Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us&#x2014;</p>

<p><strong>3 </strong>Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.</p>

<h4><span>A Voice of Warning</span></h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>President Ezra Taft Benson taught, &quot;The Book of Mormon is the &#x2018;record of a fallen people.&#x2019; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9#p9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:9</a>) Why did they fall? This is one of the major messages of the Book of Mormon. Mormon gives the answer in the closing chapters of the book in these words: &#x2018;Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</p></div><span>Nephites</span><span>, hath proven their destruction.&#x2019; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.27#p27" target="_blank">Moroni 8:27</a>) And then, lest we miss that momentous Book of Mormon message from that fallen people, the Lord warns us in the Doctrine and Covenants, &#x8F;&#x2018;Beware of pride, lest ye become as the </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>27 </strong>Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they should repent.</p></div><span>Nephites</span><span> of old.&#x2019; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.39#p39" target="_blank">D&amp;C 38:39</a>)&#x201D;&quot;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng">Beware of Pride</a>, Ensign, May 1989).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>39 </strong>And if ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</p></div></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon warns us against pride and the numerous sins which flow from it. The </span><span>Nephites</span><span> were destroyed because of apostasy, worldliness, secret combinations, false prophets, contention, and materialism. These same problems are widespread in the world today.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>By studying the forces that destroyed the </span><span>Nephite</span><span> civilization, we can be prepared to overcome the temptations and challenges of our day. We can remain worthy despite the wicked world around us. We can heed the warning of the Book of Mormon prophets and remain spiritually safe.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon warns us against the pride which destroyed the Nephite and Jaredite civilizations.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>An angel of the Lord teaches Nephi that the great and spacious building of Lehi&#x2019;s dream represents the pride of the world which will eventually fall (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36#p36" target="_blank">1 Nephi 11:36</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>36 </strong>And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p></div>
<li>Nephi sees that many churches in the latter days will be corrupted by pride (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.12-15#p12" target="_blank">2 Nephi 28:12&#x2013;15</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their churches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are puffed up.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!</p></div>
<li><span>After a season of prosperity, pride begins to enter the Church causing Alma to relinquish his position as chief judge in order to preach to the people (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.5-20#p5" target="_blank"><span>Alma </span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.5-20#p5" target="_blank">4:5&#x2013;20</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Now this man&#x2019;s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.</p></div></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized.

<p><strong>17 </strong>Now this man&#x2019;s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</p>

<li><span>The King men refuse to fight for the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> </span><span>because of their political frustrations (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.1-8#p1" target="_blank">Alma 51:1&#x2013;8</a><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.1-8,13-19#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">, 13&#x2013;19</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran.

<p><strong>18 </strong>And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton&#x2019;s band. But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called Gadianton&#x2019;s robbers and murderers.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not found.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every means in their power to destroy them off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants which Alma commanded his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.</p>

And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And they did grow in their iniquities in the sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.</p>

<p><strong>38 </strong>And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble followers of God.</p></div></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>17 </strong>For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain.</p>

<p><strong>34 </strong>And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And thus they did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble followers of God.</p></div>
<li><span>Akish</span><span> forms a secret combination to overthrow the king of the </span><span>Jaredites</span><span>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.1-26#p1" target="_blank">Ether 8:1&#x2013;26</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter many people, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And when he had gained the half of the kingdom he gave battle unto his father, and he did carry away his father into captivity, and did make him serve in captivity;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And now, in the days of the reign of Omer he was in captivity the half of his days. And it came to pass that he begat sons and daughters, among whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And they were exceedingly angry because of the doings of Jared their brother, insomuch that they did raise an army and gave battle unto Jared. And it came to pass that they did give battle unto him by night.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared they were about to slay him also; and he pled with them that they would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto his father. And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his life.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now Jared became exceedingly sorrowful because of the loss of the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and upon the glory of the world.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly expert, and seeing the sorrows of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she could redeem the kingdom unto her father.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she pleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to wife.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And Jared said unto him: I will give her unto you, if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto the house of Jared all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: Will ye swear unto me that ye will be faithful unto me in the thing which I shall desire of you?</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by their heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish desired should lose his head; and whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose his life.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And Akish did administer unto them the oaths which were given by them of old who also sought power, which had been handed down even from Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God;</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get power and gain&#x2014;and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this secret combination which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved.</p></div></li>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches how we can overcome the cycle of pride and prosperity that destroyed the </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephites.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Alma asks the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> if they are stripped of pride and prepared to meet God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.1-42#p1" target="_blank">Alma 5:1&#x2013;42</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Behold, I can tell you&#x2014;did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say&#x2014;Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth&#x2014;and that he will save you?</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these things testify against you?</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.</p></div></li>
