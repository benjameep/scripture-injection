<h3>Jesus is the Christ</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Who is Jesus Christ?</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>In the title page of the Book of Mormon, </span><span>Moroni</span><span> declares that the main purpose of the book is to &quot;the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD.&quot; &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>We live in a world where many people do not believe that Jesus is the Christ. Some deny that Jesus Christ is Jehovah of the Old Testament. Others claim that Christians twisted Old Testament prophesies to fit the life of Jesus after He died.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>Christian world has been fractured and divided for centuries over this simple question: Who is Jesus Christ? The Book of Mormon declares that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah that the ancient prophets and apostles of the Bible testified of.</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon confounds many of the philosophical creeds that are predominant in the Christian world today. Early Christian leaders debated who Jesus Christ is and a majority determined in 4</span><span>th</span><span> and 5</span><span>th</span><span> century councils that God was an ethereal essence and that Jesus was of &quot;one substance&quot; with the Father. Some Christians even deny the divine </span><span>S</span><span>onship</span><span> of Jesus Christ. They would have us believe He is the son of Joseph and Mary and not the son of God</span><span>. </span><span>They </span><span>cannot conceive </span><span>that the Father </span><span>would literally have a son &quot;after the manner of the flesh&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.18#p18" target="_blank">1 Nephi 11:18</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</p></div><span>) because of their philosophical creeds. Increasingly today Jesus is seen as a moral philosopher but not as our Savior, the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span>Even among those who do believe that He is the Savior, many disagree about who Jesus is and what He is like. </span><span>For example, some </span><span>people think Jesus is so loving and forgiving that they don&#x2019;t really need to repent or keep His commandments. Others view Jesus as so stern and strict that they feel hopeless. The Book of Mormon teaches the correct understanding of the character, perfections, and attributes of Jesus </span><span>Christ (see </span><span><a href="https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/lectures-faith-historical-perspective/lectures-faith-1990-edited-version/lecture-3">Lectures on Faith, Lecture Three</a>). As &quot;</span><span>we </span><span>come to </span><span>the knowledge of the true Messiah,&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.14#p14" target="_blank">1 Nephi 10:14</a>) and know who </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.</p></div><span>Jesus Christ really </span><span>is, </span><span>we can obtain the faith necessary for salvation.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>
<div><strong>Jesus Christ is a member of the Godhead and &quot;one&quot; with the Father and the Holy Ghost in every conceivable aspect except for their separate personages.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephi closes his teachings of the doctrine of Christ by bearing witness of the Godhead (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21#p21" target="_blank">2 Nephi 31:21</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>21 </strong>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.</p></div></li>
<li>Mormon declares we will sing praises to the Godhead because of our redemption by Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.6-7#p6" target="_blank">Mormon 7:6&#x2013;7</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</p></div>
<li>Jesus teaches the Nephites of baptism; we are to baptize in the name of all three members of the Godhead (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.23-27#p23" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:23&#x2013;27</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</p></div>
</ol>
<li>
<div class="O0"><strong>The Book of Mormon bears witness that Jesus Christ is God.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Brother of Jared sees Jesus Christ in all his pre-earth godly glory and bears record of it (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.6-16#p6" target="_blank">Ether 3:6&#x2013;16</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this?</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I shall speak?</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed himself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I show myself unto you.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</p></div></li>
<li>King Benjamin bears witness of Jesus as God who will come into the world to save the world (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.1-11#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:1&#x2013;11</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</p></div>
<li>Abinadi calls Jesus &#x201C;God himself&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.28,34#p28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 13:28, 34</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.1#p1" target="_blank">15:1</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>28 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Have they not said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?</p></div>
<li>Nephi, son of Lehi, bears witness of Christ&apos;s Godhood (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.6-7#p6" target="_blank">2 Nephi 11:6&#x2013;7</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no God we are not, for there could have been no creation. But there is a God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.</p></div>
<li>Nephi, Son of Helaman, bears witness that all prophets have born witness of Jesus as God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/8.22-23#p22" target="_blank">Helaman 8:22&#x2013;23</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches that Jesus Christ condescended to become the Son of God in the flesh.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephi sees the condescension of God the Father having a child with Mary and the condescension of God the Son becoming that child of God and Mary (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.13-23#p13" target="_blank">1 Nephi 11:13&#x2013;23</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</p></div></li>
<li>King Benjamin bears witness of the mortal Messiah&#x2019;s birth and mortal mission (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.1-10#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:1&#x2013;10</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</p>

<p><strong>3 </strong>The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father.</p></div>

<p><strong>9 </strong>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>3 </strong>Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us.

<h4>The Atonement of Jesus Christ</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon was written &quot;to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>). The Book of Mormon provides the most clear and comprehensive explanation of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in our canon of scripture. Its witness of Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer is convincing!</span><div class="callout"></div></p>
<p><span>The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the central theme of the Book of Mormon. The </span><span>Prophet Joseph Smith&#xA0;declared that &quot;the fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it&quot; (</span><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-3?lang=eng">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</a>,</span><span>&#xA0;121).</span></p>
<p><span>The prophets of the Book of Mormon all testified that &quot;Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall make an atonement for the sins of the world&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.8#p8" target="_blank">Alma 34:8</a>). During his personal ministry among the </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p></div><span>Nephites,</span><span> the Savior taught His gospel and bore witness of His atoning sacrifice testifying, &quot;I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.14#p14" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:14</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p></div></p>
<p><span>All of us desperately need the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Each of us has fallen through our mortal nature, and therefore, there is nothing we can do to save ourselves from our lost and fallen condition. No one can be saved unless they rely upon &quot;the merits, and mercy, and grace</span><span> </span><span>of the Holy Messiah.&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8#p8" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:8</a>)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.</p></div></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon&#x2019;s witness of Jesus Christ can help you gain your own testimony that He is our Savior and Redeemer. It can help you develop the faith to repent of your sins, obey His gospel, and gain eternal life.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches why an Atonement was necessary for our salvation.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Jacob teaches that without an Atonement we would be miserable forever and become subject to the devil (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.1-24#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:1&#x2013;24</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement&#x2014;save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away, that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must be fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they who have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be full forever.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li><span>Amulek</span><span> testifies that only an infinite and eternal Atonement can satisfy the demands of justice (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.1-17#p1" target="_blank">Alma 34:1&#x2013;17</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li><span>Alma teaches his son </span><span>Corianton</span><span> that the Atonement was necessary to satisfy the eternal laws of justice and mercy (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.1-31#p1" target="_blank">Alma 42:1&#x2013;31</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand&#x2014;which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken&#x2014;yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>But behold, it was appointed unto man to die&#x2014;therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth&#x2014;and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Now, if there was no law given&#x2014;if a man murdered he should die&#x2014;would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words. Amen.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Moroni</span><span> teaches that the Atonement brings men back into the presence of the Lord (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.11-13#p11" target="_blank">Mormon 9:11&#x2013;13</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Behold, he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal band of death, which death is a temporal death.</p></div></li>

<div><strong>The Book of Mormon contains the most complete teachings about the Savior&#x2019;s Atonement.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephi recounts the prophecies from the brass plates that the Savior will be scourged, lifted up, and crucified as part of his Atoning sacrifice (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.8-15#p8" target="_blank">1 Nephi 19:8&#x2013;15</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And all these things must surely come, saith the prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God of nature suffers.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of Israel, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to their fathers.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God! For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</p></div>
<li>Abinadi recounts and explains Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecy of the Atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ to the priests of King Noah (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.27-35#p27" target="_blank">Mosiah 13: 27&#x2013;35</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14.1-12#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 14:1&#x2013;12</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.6-19#p6" target="_blank">Mosiah 15: 6&#x2013;19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord&#x2014;I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions. And now, are they not his seed?</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that they are his seed.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I say unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have perished.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>27 </strong>And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people? Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began&#x2014;have they not spoken more or less concerning these things?</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Have they not said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be oppressed and afflicted?</p></div>
<li>Alma teaches the people of Gideon concerning the coming of the Son of God and his sufferings and Atonement (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.7-14#p7" target="_blank">Alma 7:7&#x2013;14</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all&#x2014;for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying&#x2014;Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</p></div>
<li>Amulek teaches Zeezrom that God cannot save us in our sins (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.34-41#p34" target="_blank">Alma 11:34&#x2013;41</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>34 </strong>And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people&#x2014;as though he had authority to command God.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</p></div>
<li>The Savior teaches&#xA0;His twelve disciples His gospel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.11-20#p11" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:11&#x2013;20</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>For their works do follow them, for it is because of their works that they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that I have told you.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you&#x2014;that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p></div>
<li>Samuel the Lamanite teaches the Nephites that Jesus must die that salvation may come (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.8-19#p8" target="_blank">Helaman 14:8&#x2013;19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</p></div>
