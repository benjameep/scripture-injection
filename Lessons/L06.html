<h3>The Doctrine of Christ: Faith and Repentance</h3>
<hr>
<h4>The Doctrine of Christ: Faith in Jesus Christ</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Lord declared that the Book of Mormon contains &quot;the&#xA0;</span><span>fullness&#xA0;of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9#p9" target="_blank">D&amp;C 20:9</a>). Within the Book of Mormon, the Savior&#x2019;s fundamental principles and ordinances necessary for salvation are sometimes referred to as the doctrine of Christ. Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel. The Book of </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</p></div><span>Mormon helps to cultivate faith in Jesus </span><span>Christ because &quot;no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.38#p38" target="_blank"><span>Moroni</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.38#p38" target="_blank"> 7:38</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>38 </strong>For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</p></div></p><div class="callout"><p><strong>38 </strong>For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</p></div>
<p><span>We live in a day of skepticism, doubt, and disbelief in God. Secularism, moral relativism, and atheism continue to erode people&#x2019;s faith. The Book of Mormon has come forth in our day to strengthen faith in Jesus Christ. It </span><span>teaches and testifies that the efficacy and virtue of </span><span>the entire plan of salvation hinges on </span><span>the mission, ministry, and message of the </span><span>Savior.</span></p>
<p><span>The prophets of the Book of Mormon taught what faith is and why it is essential to have faith in the Son of God. They confounded the false teachings of their day that eroded faith and plainly taught how to exercise faith in the Savior. Throughout the Book of Mormon, we see the blessings that flow from faith in Jesus Christ</span><span> </span><span>including visions, healings, guidance, protection, and forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span>While the philosophies of men and the wisdom of the world clamors for our attention in the latter days, there is only one source for salvation and eternal life. Your faith in the Savior</span><span> </span><span>will strengthen you to follow the doctrine of Christ and to press forward as you face life&#x2019;s challenges. Through faith you can receive the same spiritual blessings enjoyed by the people of the Book of Mormon. Your faith in Jesus Christ will lead you to eternal life.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div class="O0">
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches what faith is and why faith in Jesus Christ is necessary for salvation.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Alma teaches the poor among the apostate </span><span>Zoramites</span><span> how to begin exercising faith in the Son of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.16-43#p16" target="_blank">Alma 32:16&#x2013;43</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>16 </strong>Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And now as I said concerning faith&#x2014;faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out&#x2014;now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Now, as I said concerning faith&#x2014;that it was not a perfect knowledge&#x2014;even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves&#x2014;It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</p></div></li>
<li><span>While </span><span>abridging</span><span> the </span><span>Jaredite</span><span> record, </span><span>Moroni</span><span> teaches what faith is and the miracles that flow from faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.1-22#p1" target="_blank">Ether 12:1&#x2013;22</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that the days of Ether were in the days of Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came forth in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things are fulfilled&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe, because they saw them not.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Behold it was by faith that they of old were called after the holy order of God.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to tumble to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so great a miracle among the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even those who were before Christ and also those who were after.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should not taste of death; and they obtained not the promise until after their faith.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise that these things should come unto their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.</p></div></li>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Book of </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Mormon teaches the divine pattern for receiving the gift of faith in Jesus Christ.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>In his discourse on faith, hope, and charity, Mormon discusses the origins of faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.25-26,31-43#p25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moroni</span><span> 7:25&#x2013;26, 31&#x2013;43</span></a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>25 </strong>Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.</p></div><span>).</span></li>

<li>Lehi taught by the power of the Holy Ghost which he received through faith on the Son of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.17#p17" target="_blank">1 Nephi 10:17</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God&#x2014;and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come&#x2014;I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men.</p></div>
<li>The Liahona led Lehi and Nephi according to their faith and obedience (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.28-29#p28" target="_blank">1 Nephi 16:28&#x2013;29</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>28 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it. And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.</p></div>
<li>Nephi explains how his people were made alive in Christ through faith in Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.25#p25" target="_blank">2 Nephi 25:25</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>25 </strong>For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.</p></div>

<li>Zeezrom is healed by Alma through faith in the redemption of Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/15.6-11#p6" target="_blank">Alma 15:6&#x2013;11</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?</p>

<p><strong>8 </strong>And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be healed.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.</p></div>
<li>Angels minister to Nephi and he performs miracles because of his great faith in the Savior (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.18-19#p18" target="_blank">3 Nephi 7:18&#x2013;19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</p></div>

And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.</p></div>
<li>The 2,000 stripling warriors receive hope, assurance, and strength because of their great faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.8-12#p8" target="_blank">Alma 58:8&#x2013;12</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And we did take courage with our small force which we had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of our liberty.</p></div>

<p><strong>5 </strong>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</p>

<h4>The Doctrine of Christ: Repentance</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>&#xA0;The </span><span>second principle of the doctrine of Christ is repentance. In </span><span>a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared that the Book of Mormon was brought forth so that the Lamanites and those in the latter days &quot;may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that </span><span>through their repentance they might be saved&quot;</span><span>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.20#p20" target="_blank">D&amp;C 3:20</a>). Having faith in Jesus Christ and in His atonement naturally leads individuals to repent of their sins, believing they can receive forgiveness. As Samuel the </span><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. Amen.</p></div><span>Lamanite</span><span> taught the </span><span>Nephites</span><span>&#xA0;&quot;if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.13#p13" target="_blank"><span>Helaman</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.13#p13" target="_blank"> 14:13</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</p></div></p><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your sins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits.</p></div>
<p><span>The world is in dire need of repentance, yet few people have sufficient faith in the Savior to believe they can change. Some in the Christian world even teach that repentance is not necessary and that &quot;faith alone&quot; can save us or that God will save us </span><span>in our sins</span><span>. The Book of Mormon affirms that repentance is necessary for our salvation. It teaches that even the vilest of sinners can repent and be changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. From the Book of Mormon we learn the essential components of the repentance process. We learn how to be born again, and to become the children of Christ. We learn how we can one day stand spotless before the judgment seat of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span>Regardless of what you may have done in the past, you can repent of your sins and be forgiven. The Lord can loose you from the chains of sin and deliver you from the bondage of addiction. Whether your sins be great or small, you can receive the sweet gift of forgiveness as you fully repent of all your sins.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that repentance is necessary for salvation and that this life is the time to prepare to meet God.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Amulek teaches the apostate </span><span>Zoramites</span><span> not to procrastinate their repentance (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.31-37#p31" target="_blank">Alma 34:31&#x2013;37</a>).&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>31 </strong>Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;</p></div></li>
<li><span>Amulek</span><span> teaches the lawyer </span><span>Zeezrom</span><span> that God cannot save His people in their sins (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.32-40#p32" target="_blank">Alma 11:32&#x2013;40</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>32 </strong>And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And he said unto him, Yea.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people&#x2014;as though he had authority to command God.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</p></div></li>
<li>The Savior teaches the Father&#x2019;s commandment to repent and believe in Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.31-32#p31" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:31&#x2013;32</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>31 </strong>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</p></div>
<li><span>Jesus teaches the </span><span>Nephite</span><span> disciples his gospel and teaches why repentance is necessary for salvation (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19-20#p19" target="_blank">3 Nephi 27:19&#x2013;20</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches how we can be born again through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Alma and the sons of Mosiah persecute the Church, are visited by an angel, and have a mighty change of heart (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.8-33#p8" target="_blank">Mosiah 27:8&#x2013;33</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength&#x2014;that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</p></div>
<li><span>Alma recounts his conversion experience to his son </span><span>Helaman&#xA0;</span><span>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.5-26#p5" target="_blank">Alma 36:5&#x2013;26</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself;</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words&#x2014;If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God&#x2014;I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.</p></div></li>

<div class="O0"><strong>True repentance leads to confessing, forsaking our sins, and repairing any injuries we may have caused.</strong></div>

<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Sons of Mosiah show by their actions that they have been born again (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.34-37#p34" target="_blank">Mosiah 27:34&#x2013;37</a>).&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>34 </strong>And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</p></div></li>
<li>King of the Anti-Nephi-Lehi recounts how his people were forgiven and encourages his people to bury their swords as a symbol of their complete repentance (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.6-19#p6" target="_blank">Alma 24:6&#x2013;19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>6 </strong>Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which we have committed.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man&#x2019;s blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man&#x2019;s blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.</p></div>
<li>Alma counsels his son Corianton to repent of his sins and turn to God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.7-15#p7" target="_blank">Alma 39:7&#x2013;15</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities;</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.</p></div>

<li>The Lord reveals to Alma (the elder) how to administer church discipline and promises to forgive those who repent (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.29-32#p29" target="_blank">Mosiah 26:29&#x2013;32</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>29 </strong>Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor&#x2019;s trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</p></div>
<li>Mormon invites the Gentiles of the latter-days to repent of their wickedness and abominations (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/30.1-2#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 30:1&#x2013;2</a>). Moroni teaches that as often as the members of the church repented they were forgiven (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.7-8#p7" target="_blank">Moroni 6:7&#x2013;8</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And they were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and three witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders, and if they repented not, and confessed not, their names were blotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real intent, they were forgiven.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, which he hath commanded me that I should speak concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should write, saying:</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of your evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders, and your priestcrafts, and your envyings, and your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel.</p></div>
