<h3>Missionary Work</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Missionary Work</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon was written to convince everyone, both Jews and Gentiles, that &quot;Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank">title page</a>). Missionary work is therefore a central theme and one of the divine purposes of the Book of Mormon. Elder David A. </span><div class="callout"></div><span>Bednar</span><span> explained that &#xA0;&quot;the Book of Mormon in combination with the Spirit of the Lord is &#x2018;the greatest single tool which God has given us to convert the world.&#x2019;&#xA0;This Restoration volume of scripture is the keystone of our religion and is essential in bringing souls to the Savior.&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/10/missionary-family-history-and-temple-work?lang=eng">Missionary, Family History, and Temple Work</a>,&#xA0;</span><span>Ensign</span><span>, Oct. 2014).</span></p>
<p><span>Today there are more missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than there have been at any time in our history. The Book of Mormon was uniquely prepared to help members and missionaries to teach the gospel with power and authority and to bring souls unto Christ. Throughout its pages, the Book of Mormon shows the challenges and joys of sharing the gospel, as well as the importance of what and how to teach.</span></p>
<p><span>We live in the long prophesied day when the gospel of Jesus Christ is being &quot;declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.28#p28" target="_blank">Mosiah 15:28</a>). As we study the Book of Mormon, we can learn how to be effective instruments in the hands of the Lord in inviting all to come unto Christ and to live His gospel.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>28 </strong>And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</p></div></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div class="O0">
<ol>
<li><strong>Those who are born again through the Atonement of Jesus Christ naturally desire to share the gospel message with others.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>During his dream, Lehi felt a desire to share the sweet fruit of the tree of life with his family (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.10-12#p10" target="_blank">1 Nephi 8:10&#x2013;12</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.</p></div>
<li><span>After receiving forgiveness of his sins, </span><span>Enos</span><span> prayed for his brethren the Nephites and later for the Lamanites (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.9-13#p9" target="_blank"><span>Enos</span><span> 1:9&#x2013;13</span></a><span>).</span></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>9 </strong>Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him&#x2014;that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation&#x2014;</p></div>
<li><span>After being forced to flee from the presence of King Noah, Alma begins to teach the words of </span><span>Abinadi</span><span> and the gospel in private. Many believe in his words (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.1-7#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 18:1&#x2013;7</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king. And many did believe his words.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</p></div></li>
<li><span>The Sons of Mosiah desired to share the gospel with the Lamanites after repenting of their sins (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.1-7#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah </a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.1-7#p1" target="_blank">28:1&#x2013;7</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</p></div></li>
<li><span>After recounting his conversion experience to his son </span><span>Helaman</span><span>, Alma explains the joy he experienced in sharing the gospel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.23-26#p23" target="_blank">Alma 36:23&#x2013;26</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches how to spiritually prepare to preach the gospel by the Spirit.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>The Sons of Mosiah prepared themselves spiritually and received revelation about how to share the gospel with the Lamanites (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.1-13#p1" target="_blank">Alma 17:1&#x2013;13</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the people;</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.</p></div>
<li>Alma counsels his son Shiblon&#xA0;regarding his missionary efforts (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.3-5,10-15#p3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 38:3&#x2013;5, 10&#x2013;15</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>3 </strong>I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word&#x2019;s sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy&#x2014;yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Teaching the gospel with&#xA0;the influence of the Holy Ghost helps individuals to have a mighty change of heart.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Ammon teaches King </span><span>Lamoni</span><span> as he is guided by the Holy Spirit (Alma 18 &amp; 19).</span></li>
<li><span>Aaron teaches King </span><span>Lamoni&#x2019;s</span><span> father the nature of God, the plan of salvation, and how to pray and ask for forgiveness (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.1-26#p1" target="_blank">Alma 22:1&#x2013;26</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king&#x2019;s palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said concerning the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And also, what is this that Ammon said&#x2014;If ye will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou this?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will believe thy words.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king&#x2014;how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were dead.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now the servants had seen the cause of the king&#x2019;s fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there should be a great contention and a disturbance among them; therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to minister unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them because of Aaron and his brethren.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them. And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Nephi and Lehi preach the gospel with power and authority among the Lamanites, and many believe and are converted (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12-52#p12" target="_blank"><span>Helaman</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12-52#p12" target="_blank"> 5:12&#x2013;52</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them that they might slay them.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake as if they were about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall. And behold, they that were in the prison were Lamanites and Nephites who were dissenters.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud of darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon them.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And it came to pass that there came a voice as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my servants whom I have sent unto you to declare good tidings.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice, behold the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold the cloud of darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not disperse&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvelous words which cannot be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable because of the fear which did come upon them.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from them.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the faces of angels. And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look. And behold, there was power given unto them that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean, and who is it with whom these men do converse?</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>Now the man&#x2019;s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab said unto them: They do converse with the angels of God.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness was dispersed.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, behold, they saw that they were encircled about, yea every soul, by a pillar of fire.</p>
<p><strong>44 </strong>And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
<p><strong>45 </strong>And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.</p>
<p><strong>46 </strong>And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:</p>
<p><strong>47 </strong>Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, who was from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p><strong>48 </strong>And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.</p>
<p><strong>49 </strong>And there were about three hundred souls who saw and heard these things; and they were bidden to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.</p>
<p><strong>50 </strong>And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the people, declaring throughout all the regions round about all the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidences which they had received.</p>
<p><strong>51 </strong>And as many as were convinced did lay down their weapons of war, and also their hatred and the tradition of their fathers.</p>
<p><strong>52 </strong>And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites the lands of their possession.</p></div></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.</p>

<p><strong>38 </strong>And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean, and who is it with whom these men do converse?</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>Now the man&#x2019;s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab said unto them: They do converse with the angels of God.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.</p>

</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches the tremendous joy that comes from being an instrument in the Lord&#x2019;s hands and helping others to come unto Jesus Christ.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Ammon </span><span>glories in the Lord and in being an instrument in His hands in sharing the gospel with the Lamanites (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.1-37#p1" target="_blank">Alma 26:1&#x2013;37</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into the fold of God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to God.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting light, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards the children of men? Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to destroy his church.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal despair?</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth these things? I say unto you, there is none that knoweth these things, save it be the penitent.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing&#x2014;unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world&#x2014;not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li>Alma wishes he were an angel, and expresses gratitude for the privilege of being an instrument in the hands of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1-10,14-17#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 29: 1&#x2013;10, 14&#x2013;17</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth?</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward!</p>

<p><strong>17 </strong>And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen.</p></div>

<h4><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">The Scattering and Gathering of Israel</span></h4>
<h5><strong><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">Introduction</span></strong></h5>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon was written primarily to &quot;the remnant of the House of Israel,&quot; so that they could &#x201C;know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank">title page</a>). The Book of Mormon is the instrument God has prepared to bring about the promised gathering of Israel. Elder Russell M. Nelson taught that &quot;the Book of Mormon declares the advent of the gathering&#xA0;and is God&#x2019;s instrument to bring about that gathering. Without the Book of Mormon, there would be no gathering of Israel.&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2014/07/the-book-of-mormon-the-gathering-of-israel-and-the-second-coming?lang=eng">The Book of Mormon, the Gathering of Israel, and the Second Coming</a>, Ensign, July 2014).&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"></div></p>
<p><span>So, when and why was Israel scattered? Throughout Israel&#x2019;s history they have been scattered as they have rejected the Lord and his prophets and have broken their covenants. The Book of Mormon discusses three of the most significant scatterings which Israel has experienced in its history.</span></p>
<p><span>First, the northern kingdom of Israel, consisting most of the ten tribes, was scattered by the Assyrians in 722 B.C., and they have become known as the lost ten tribes.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, the southern kingdom of Judah and its capitol city of Jerusalem were destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C., and many Jews were carried captive into Babylon. Fifty years later, after Babylon was overrun by the Persians, King Cyrus permitted some of the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple.</span></p>
<p><span>The final significant scattering of Israel occurred in 70 A.D. when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans as the Savior had foretold during his ministry.&#xA0; </span></p>
<p><span>Why is the scattering of Israel significant for us today? The Book of Mormon teaches that although Israel was scattered, the Lord would preserve his covenant people, and gather them again in the latter days. For anyone who has felt forgotten, left behind, or abandoned, the prophesies of the Book of Mormon concerning the gathering of Israel teach that God has never forgotten&#xA0;His people. Today the Lord is working in mighty power to gather scattered Israel to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, to a knowledge of the covenants of the Lord, and to the priesthood power and saving ordinances restored to the earth and found only within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</span></p>
<p><span>We are part of the remnant of scattered Israel that the Book of Mormon was written to. One by one, the Lord is gathering His people to His gospel and His church. We are privileged to live in a day when the Lord is gathering Israel, both living and dead, through our missionary efforts and temple work. This is part of the fulfillment that through the posterity of Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Lord scattered the descendants of Israel because they broke their covenants and did not remember the Lord.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li>Nephi recounts Lehi&#x2019;s teachings that they are part of the scattering of the House of Israel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.12-14#p12" target="_blank">1 Nephi 10:12&#x2013;14</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared like unto an olive tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led with one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.</p></div>
<li><span>Nephi quotes the prophet </span><span>Zenos</span><span> regarding the scattering of Israel because they have rejected the Lord (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.13-17#p13" target="_blank">1 Nephi 19:13&#x2013;17</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of Israel, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to their fathers.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in, saith the Lord, according to the words of the prophet Zenos, from the four quarters of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord, saith the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and people shall be blessed.</p></div></li>
<li>Isaiah compares Israel to a vineyard that will be destroyed because of wickedness (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.1-7#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 15:1&#x2013;7</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And then will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved, touching his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes it brought forth wild grapes.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard&#x2014;I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down;</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for judgment, and behold, oppression; for righteousness, but behold, a cry.</p></div>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Book of </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Mormon teaches that a remnant of the House of Israel will be gathered in the latter days.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Nephi teaches his brothers that they are a remnant of Israel and that their posterity will be gathered in the latter days (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.7,12-18#p7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 15:7, 12&#x2013;18</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive tree, and also concerning the Gentiles.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared unto an olive tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our father; and behold are we not broken off from the house of Israel, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive tree, into the true olive tree.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li>Isaiah teaches that the Kings and Queens of the Gentiles will gather remnant of Israel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21.5-6,22-26#p5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 21:5&#x2013;6, 22&#x2013;26</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>And now, saith the Lord&#x2014;that formed me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him&#x2014;though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives delivered?</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p></div>
<li>Jacob expounds on Isaiah relative to the scattering and gathering of Israel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6.4-18#p4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 6:4&#x2013;18</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be likened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now, these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words. For behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away captive.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be suffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful; they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together again to the lands of their inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe in him.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And they that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p></div>
<li>Jacob quotes Isaiah counseling his people to look unto Abraham (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8.1-2#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 8:1&#x2013;2</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare you; for I called him alone, and blessed him.</p></div>
<li>Jacob teaches that the Lord gathers his people because of his mercy and grace (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.1-2,53#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 9:1&#x2013;2, 53</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.</p>
<p><strong>53 </strong>And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.</p></div>
<li>Jacob finishes his discourse, teaching that the Lord will gather both the Gentiles and the Jews to a knowledge of his covenants (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.1-22#p1" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:1&#x2013;22</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ&#x2014;for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name&#x2014;should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him&#x2014;for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be their God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore, the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute?</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And I will fortify this land against all other nations.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish; for they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they who are not for me are against me, saith our God.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a better land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us also.</p></div>
<li>Isaiah prophesies that a remnant of Jacob will return to the Lord (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/20.21-22#p21" target="_blank">2 Nephi 20:21&#x2013;22</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>21 </strong>The remnant shall return, yea, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</p>

<li>Isaiah prophesies that a root of Jesse will stand for an ensign to the nations and to gather the dispersed of Israel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.1-2,9-16#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 21:1&#x2013;2, 9&#x2013;16</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.</p>

<p><strong>9 </strong>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and his rest shall be glorious.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>The envy of Ephraim also shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines towards the west; they shall spoil them of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind he shall shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</p></div>

<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephi prophesies that Israel will be gathered after they believe in Christ and His Atonement (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.14-20#p14" target="_blank">2 Nephi 25:14&#x2013;20</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind&#x2014;and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</p></div><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">).</span></li>
<li>Nephi prophesies that Israel will be gathered to a knowledge of the covenants of the Lord and to know the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.1-12,25#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 22:1&#x2013;12, 25</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh?</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And since they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel; for against him will they harden their hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be hated of all men.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed by the Gentiles, and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and their children have been carried in their arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders, behold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.</p></div>

<li>The Savior teaches the twelve disciples regarding the gathering of Israel (3 Nephi 15&#x2013;16).</li>
<li><span>Jesus </span><span>teaches the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> that he will fulfill his covenants and gather the House of Israel to the lands of their inheritance (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.12-31#p12" target="_blank">3 Nephi 20:12&#x2013;31</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when they shall be fulfilled then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father hath made unto his people, O house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And then shall the remnants, which shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from the west, and from the south and from the north; and they shall be brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath redeemed them.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you this land, for your inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after the blessing which they shall receive, after they have scattered my people&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I will gather my people together as a man gathereth his sheaves into the floor.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>For I will make my people with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth it.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword of my justice shall hang over them at that day; and except they repent it shall fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have testified of me.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye are the children of the covenant&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the covenant which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed&#x2014;unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above all, unto the scattering of my people, O house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And they shall be a scourge unto the people of this land. Nevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my gospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will return their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever, saith the Father.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the fulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them;</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>And they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
