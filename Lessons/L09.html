<h4>The Ministry of Christ Among the Nephites</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;In the Book of </span><span>&#xA0;</span><span>Mormon, the &quot;crowning event ... is </span><span>the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> soon after His resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to </span><span>come&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng" target="_blank">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>).&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"></div></p>
<p><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Jesus Christ visited the ancient inhabitants of America and declared, </span><span>&quot;I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the </span><span>world&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.10#p10" target="_blank"><span>3</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.10#p10" target="_blank"> Nephi 11:10</a>). Standing before His people as an immortal, perfected, resurrected being, Jesus testified in a magnificent manner that he had fulfilled the will of the Father and taken upon him the sins of the world. Then he invited the people to feel the prints of the nails in his hands and feet.</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p></div></p><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p></div>
<p><span>&#xA0;</span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0; Speaking of this moving account,&#xA0; Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained, &quot;everyone </span><span>had talked of him, sung of him, dreamed of him, and prayed for his </span><span>appearance&#x2014;but </span><span>here he actually was. The day of days! The God who turns every dark night into morning light had </span><span>arrived&quot; (</span><span>Christ and the New Covenant</span><span>, p. 251).</span></p>
<p><span>&#xA0;</span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0; The Book of Mormon account of the Savior&#x2019;s personal ministry and teachings among the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> help us to know the Savior and live </span><span>H</span><span>is gospel. After we have entered into covenants to follow the Savior, His teachings help prepare us for eternal life.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon includes an account of some of the Savior&#x2019;s ministering to the Nephites following His resurrection.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Jesus Christ descends and ministers to the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> in the city of Bountiful and shows them his hands and feet (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.1-30#p1" target="_blank">3 </a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name&#x2014;hear ye him.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them&#x2014;Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</p></div><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.1-30#p1" target="_blank"><span>Nephi&#xA0;</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.1-30#p1" target="_blank">11:1&#x2013;30</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.</p>

<p><strong>28 </strong>And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</p></div>
<li><span>The Savior has compassion upon the </span><span>Nephites</span><span>, heals their sick, and blesses the little children (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.1-25#p1" target="_blank">3 Nephi 17:1&#x2013;25</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked round about again on the multitude, and he said unto them: Behold, my time is at hand.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And when he had done this he wept again;</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.</p></div></li>
<li>Following the administration of the sacrament, Jesus teaches the people to pray in their families and to let their lights shine (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.13-39#p13" target="_blank">3 Nephi 18:13&#x2013;39</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said unto them:</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my name.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up&#x2014;that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them:</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And I give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been among you. And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I should go unto the Father for your sakes.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you hereafter that this record is true.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and ascended into heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.</p></div>

<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon includes some of the teachings of the Savior to the </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephites.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>The Savior teaches His doctrine, including the first principles and ordinances of the gospel (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.31-41#p31" target="_blank">3 Nephi 11:31&#x2013;41</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>31 </strong>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>39 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.</p></div>
