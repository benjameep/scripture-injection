<h3>Divine Origins and Purposes of the Book of Mormon</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Divine Origins of&#xA0;the Book of Mormon</h4>
<h5><span><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h5>
<p><span>Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon &quot;the keystone of our religion&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>). It is tangible evidence that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. President Ezra Taft Benson asked &quot;How important is the Book of Mormon? ... Just as the arch crumbles&#xA0;if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it&quot;</span><div class="callout"></div><span>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-ezra-taft-benson/chapter-9-the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson</a></span><span>, 128).</span></p>
<p><span>In </span><span>the world today, many people have tried to attack, or at the very least dismiss, the Prophet Joseph Smith&#x2019;s claim that the Book of Mormon has a divine origin</span><span>. </span><span>Some have called it a fake or a fraud. Others have called it a genius work from the mind of Joseph himself, rather than </span><span>a divine ancient </span><span>record </span><span>of scripture. Each individual must decide for themselves whether the Book of Mormon is fact or fiction, devilish or divine.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding this challenge, President Gordon B. Hinckley taught that &quot;</span><span>Joseph&#x2019;s story of the gold plates was fantastic. It was hard to believe and easy to challenge. Could he have written it of his own capacity? It is here, my brothers and sisters, for everyone to see, to handle, to read. Every attempt to explain its origin, other than that which he gave, has fallen of its own weight. He was largely unschooled; and yet, in a very brief time, he brought forth the translation which in published form comes to more than 500 pages.</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;... Through </span><span>all of these years critics have tried to explain it. They have spoken against it. They have ridiculed it. But it has outlived them all, and its influence today is greater than at any time in its history</span><span>&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/the-stone-cut-out-of-the-mountain?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stone Cut Out of the Mountain</a></span><span>,&#xA0;Ensign, Nov. </span><span>2007).</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon is exactly what it claims to be. It is another testament of Jesus Christ. It is a record of inspired scripture written by ancient prophets. Joseph Smith brought it forth &quot;by the gift and power of God&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>). As you study the Book of Mormon, you can pray for a witness to know if it is true, if its message that Jesus is the Christ is true, and if its messenger, Joseph Smith, was a true prophet.</span><div class="callout"></div></p>

<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches the divine origin and inspired purposes of the book.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Moroni wrote the title page of the Book of Mormon.

<p><strong>13 </strong>And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!</p></div><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">).</span></li>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work;</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the which shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear record&#x2014;and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now, if I have no authority for these things, judge ye; for ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand before God at the last day. Amen.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>12 </strong>Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve thy seed forever.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And the Lord said unto me also: I will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will give unto him that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And the words which he shall write shall be the words which are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust; for I know their faith.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto their brethren, even after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers.</p></div></li>

<div><strong>The Book of Mormon testifies that it was written on plates, and that special interpreters were prepared for the plates to be translated.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li>
<div><span>Nephi explains how he was commanded to record the history of his people upon two sets of plates (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9.1-6#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 9:1&#x2013;6</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a great many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people; wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen.</p></div></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Nephi </span><span>explains that the plates were reserved for sacred things (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.1-6#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 19:1&#x2013;6</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions and destructions of my people. And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I was gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until further commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I have spoken; and this I do that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.</p></div></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span></span>Thirty years after leaving Jerusalem, Nephi is commanded to make a second record of plates (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.28-34#p28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 5:28&#x2013;34</a>).</div><div class="callout"><p><strong>28 </strong>And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I had made, of my people thus far.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people they must search mine other plates.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Mormon explains his abridgment and compilation of records to create the Book of Mormon (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1.1-11#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Words of Mormon 1:1&#x2013;11</a>).</div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people. But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit them.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come to pass&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until the days of king Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Moroni</span><span> teaches that the plates can only be translated by the power of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.14-16#p14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mormon 8:14&#x2013;16</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For none can have power to bring it to light save it be given him of God; for God wills that it shall be done with an eye single to his glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.</p></div></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span></span>The Lord teaches the Brother of Jared that one day his record will come forth with the aid of two stones which God had prepared to interpret languages (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.22-28#p22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ether 3:22&#x2013;28</a>).</div><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye shall write them in a language that they cannot be read.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>For behold, the language which ye shall write I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe in him that he could show unto him all things&#x2014;it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up the two stones which he had received, and show them not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of men.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Ammon teaches king </span><span>Limhi</span><span> </span><span>of special instruments used to translate ancient records known as interpreters (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.13-19#p13" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 8:13&#x2013;19</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</p></div><span>).</span></div>

<h4>The Book of Mormon Bears Witness of the Truthfulness of the Bible</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>In the title page of the Book of Mormon, </span><span>Moroni</span><span> declares that one of the main purposes of the book is &quot;to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD.&quot; &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon and the Bible both testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Savior of the world. The Holy Bible contains the word of the Lord as given to the ancient Jews and Christians. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon testify of Jesus&#x2019; Christ&#x2019;s ministry as the Jehovah of the Old Testament and the Savior of the New Testament. As we learn to love, appreciate, and use both of these inspired records, their divine missions will be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span>We are living in a world that increasingly denies the truthfulness of the witness of the Holy Bible. The Book of Mormon stands as a witness that the Bible is &quot;of great worth unto the gentiles&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.23#p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 13:23</a>).&#xA0;</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book that thou beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles.</p></div></p>
<p><span>How important are the words of the Lord? Lehi and his family could not begin their </span><span>j</span><span>ourney before returning to Jerusalem and retrieving the brass plates from Laban. These brass plates constituted much of what we now call the Old Testament, as well as additional prophecies that were not included in the Holy Bible. These teachings were of such great worth that Nephi was commanded to kill Laban in order to get the plates.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Do we appreciate that Nephi and Jacob&#x2019;s use of Isaiah confirms that he was a true biblical prophet? Do we realize that when we are reading the account of the Jaredites, that it begins with the confounding of the languages at the tower of Babel, an event which the world declares to be unhistorical and mythical? These and many other witnesses from the Book of Mormon consistently testify that the biblical witness of Jesus Christ and His work among his ancient covenant people is true.</span></p>

<li>Lehi examines the recently acquired brass plates and finds them to be &#x201C;desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.10-22#p10" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 5:10&#x2013;22</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the records.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.</p></div>

<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</p></div></li>
<li>Alma recounts to his son Helaman how important the brass plates have been for the Nephites and for the conversion of the Lamanites (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.1-14#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 37:1&#x2013;14</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which have been entrusted with me;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a wise purpose that they are kept.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land&#x2014;but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.</p></div>

<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a book, and it was carried forth among them.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the book?</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And I said unto him: I know not.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.

<p><strong>24 </strong>And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that the book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness of the gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the truth which is in the Lamb of God.</p>

The Book of Mormon also witnesses that other Latter-day records &quot;shall establish the truth of the [Bible]&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.39-42#p39" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 13:39&#x2013;42</a>)</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>39 </strong>And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.</p>
<p><strong>40 </strong>And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>And they must come according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both shall be established in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd over all the earth.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after he has manifested himself unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>26 </strong>And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that great and abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And all this have they done that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And after these plain and precious things were taken away it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity, thou seest&#x2014;because of the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of the book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children of men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God&#x2014;because of these things which are taken away out of the gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath great power over them.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other nations, upon the face of the land which is choice above all other lands, which is the land that the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which are among thy brethren.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the seed of thy brethren.</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou beholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel in great judgment.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the remnant of the house of Israel&#x2014;and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father&#x2014;wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb&#x2014;I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>And in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.</p>
<p><strong>38 </strong>And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>3 </strong>Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.</p></div>
<li><span>Nephi and Alma teach the </span><span>simpleness</span><span> of living the gospel by recounting the story of Moses and the serpent of brass upon the pole from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/21.4-9#p4" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 21:4&#x2013;9</a> (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41#p41" target="_blank">1 Nephi 17:41</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/33.18-22#p18" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 33:18&#x2013;22</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>41 </strong>And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for they hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straitened them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>&#xB6; And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>&#xB6; Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p></div></li>

<li><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">The Tower of Babel and the confounding of languages as found in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/11.1-9#p1" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 11:1&#x2013;9</a> is attested to by the account of the beginnings of the Jaredite civilization (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/1.33-37#p33" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ether 1:33&#x2013;37</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>33 </strong>Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were scattered.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded.</p>
<p><strong>36 </strong>Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends, that he confound not their language.</p>
<p><strong>37 </strong>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon their friends and their families also, that they were not confounded.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&#x2019;s speech.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p></div></li>
<li>An angel reveals to Nephi that the remainder of his vision would be recorded by the Apostle John, which became the book of revelation (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.18-27#p18" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 14:18&#x2013;27</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, and also many things which have been.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And he shall also write concerning the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true; and behold they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the understanding of all men.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And behold, the things which this apostle of the Lamb shall write are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the remainder shalt thou see.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should write them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.</p></div>
<li>The Book of Mormon affirms that Jesus Christ has a glorified resurrected body as recorded in the Bible (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.8-15#p8" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Nephi 11:8&#x2013;15</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</p></div>
<li>Lehi beheld that the brass plates contained the five books of Moses, proving that they were written well before the Babylonian captivity (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.10-11#p10" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 5:10&#x2013;11</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</p>

<li>Jacob teaches his people that both David and Solomon were actual Kings of Israel and were not made up in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.23-24#p23" lang="eng&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob 2:23&#x2013;24</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes.

<p><strong>24 </strong>Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</p></div>
