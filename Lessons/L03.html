<h3>The Covenants and Promises of the Lord unto the House of Israel</h3>
<hr>
<h4><span>The Covenants and Promises of the Lord unto the House of Israel</span></h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>One of the central purposes of the Book of Mormon is to help th</span><span>ose in the latter days</span><span>&#xA0;to &quot;know the covenants of the </span><span>Lord,</span><span> that they are not cast off forever&quot;</span><span>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title page of the Book of Mormon</a></span><div class="callout"></div><span>).&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Many people in the world today</span><span> wonder if there is a God </span><span>or whether He cares about them. They feel hopeless or &quot;cast off forever.&quot; The Book of Mormon can bring hope to those who feel abandoned by God. It testifies that God makes and always keeps His covenants with those who believe in Him and keep His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span>So what are the covenants and promises the Lord has made to us? </span><span>God</span><span> has promised through all his holy prophets that he would send a Savior to make an atonement for all mankind.</span><span> He promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life to those who serve Him and keep</span><span> His commandments. </span><span>Anciently, God also made special</span><span> promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who became known as Israel. The Lord</span><span> </span><span>promised Abraham and his posterity lands of everlasting inheritance, an endless posterity, and the </span><span>blessings and responsibilities </span><span>of the priesthood. In addition, God covenanted with Abraham that his posterity would be a means of blessing all the families of the </span><span>earth.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Either by literal descent</span><span> or by adoption through baptism, we are the children of Abraham. We are the Lord&#x2019;s covenant people today, just </span><span>as </span><span>the people of the Book of Mormon were anciently. </span><span>Lehi and his posterity</span><span> were given a promised land, visited and taught by the promised Savior, and given&#xA0;</span><span>assurances that</span><span> their posterity would receive the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the latter&#xA0;days. </span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon is evidence that God still remembers </span><span>H</span><span>is covenants and </span><span>H</span><span>is covenant people&#x2014;they are not cast off forever. As we make and keep our covenants with God we will be blessed both spiritually and temporally, and we will ultimately receive the Lords&#x2019; promise of eternal life.&#xA0;</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>
<div><strong>The Book of Mormon promises that those who keep the commandments will prosper in the land.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Before leaving Jerusalem, the Lord promises Nephi that inasmuch as he keeps the commandments, he will prosper in the land&#xA0; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.19-21#p19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 2:19&#x2013;21</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.1,30#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 36:1, 30</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is according to his word.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li>
<div><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that those who keep their covenants are blessed temporally and spiritually.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">King Benjamin testifies of the temporal and spiritual blessings that come to those who keep the commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41#p41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosiah 2:41</a>)</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>41 </strong>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p></div></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Mormon </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">testifies of the peace and prosperity that comes to the righteous while recounting the happiness of the </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Nephites</span> <span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">under the protection of Captain </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Moroni</span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;"> (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/50.18-23#p18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 50:18&#x2013;23</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Following Captain </span><span>Moroni&#x2019;s</span><span> war with the Lamanites, the </span><span>Nephites</span><span> prosper as they remember the Lord and keep the commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/62.48-51#p48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 62:48&#x2013;51</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>48 </strong>And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the land. And they began to grow exceedingly rich.</p>
<p><strong>49 </strong>But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.</p>
<p><strong>50 </strong>Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>51 </strong>And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li>
<div><strong>The Lord always remembers His covenants and His covenant people.</strong></div>
</li>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Lord affirms through the Prophet Isaiah that he will never forget the House of Israel because they are graven upon the palms of His hands (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21.14-16#p14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Nephi 21:14&#x2013;16</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me&#x2014;but he will show that he hath not.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</p></div></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">Lord teaches Israel that although they have broken their covenants, the Lord retains the power and determination to fulfill His covenants (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/7.1-11#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 7:1&#x2013;11</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother&#x2019;s divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of Israel. When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For the Lord God will help me. And all they who shall condemn me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand&#x2014;ye shall lie down in sorrow.</p></div></li>
<li>The Savior recounts the words of Isaiah declaring that the Lord&#x2019;s covenant will never be removed and his covenant people will be remembered (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22.1-17#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3&#xA0; Nephi 22:1&#x2013;17</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes;</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel&#x2014;the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For this, the waters of Noah unto me, for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>In righteousness shalt thou be established; thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear, and from terror for it shall not come near thee.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Behold, they shall surely gather together against thee, not by me; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.</p></div>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches that we should be willing to make every sacrifice necessary in order to keep our covenants.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>The Anti-Nephi-Lehies bury their weapons of war and covenant with God that they will give up their lives rather than shed the blood of their brethren (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.1-30#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 24:1&#x2013;30</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which we have committed.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man&#x2019;s blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man&#x2019;s blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things.</p></div>
<li>Helaman persuades the people of Ammon to keep their covenant not to fight against the Lamanites, and the 2,000 stripling warriors covenant to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.10-22#p10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 53:10&#x2013;22</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>10 </strong>And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had made.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.</p>

<p><strong>7 </strong>And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.</p>

<p><strong>10 </strong>Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</p>

<p><strong>13 </strong>And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his people. O God, receive my soul.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.</p></div>

<p><strong>5 </strong>But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in unbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord&#x2014;having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise&#x2014;behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten.</p>

<p><strong>7 </strong>For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away.</p>

<li>Captain Moroni creates the Title of Liberty and encourages the people to remember their God, their freedom, and their families (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.12-27#p12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 46:12&#x2013;27</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it&#x2014;In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children&#x2014;and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south&#x2014;A chosen land, and the land of liberty.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he said&#x2014;Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.</p></div>

<p><strong>11 </strong>But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins&#x2014;and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</p></div>

<div><strong>The Lord promised to preserve the records of the Nephites and bring them forth in the latter days as a witness of the true Messiah, Jesus Christ.</strong></div>

<li><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">Enos pleads with the Lord to preserve the records of the </span><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">Nephites</span><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;"> for the benefit of their brethren (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.11-16#p11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">Enos</span><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;"> 1:11&#x2013;16</span></a><span style="text-indent: 0.65em;">).</span></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him&#x2014;that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.</p></div>
<li>Alma entrusts his son Helaman with the Nephite records and commands him to preserve them (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.13-19#p13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma 37:13&#x2013;19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land&#x2014;but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future generations.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.</p></div>
<li>Mormon affirms that his record will be a fulfillment of the Lord&#x2019;s promise to bring forth the words of the Nephites to help the House of Israel to a knowledge of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.12-26#p12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Nephi 5:12&#x2013;26</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>12 </strong>And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people, yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And it hath become expedient that I, according to the will of God, that the prayers of those who have gone hence, who were the holy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should make a record of these things which have been done&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have been given by those who were before me, until the commencement of my day;</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our language, we are not able to write.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and proceed to give my account of the things which have been before me.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob, who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be. Amen.</p></div>
<li>The Savior taught the Nephites that the coming forth of the Book of Mormon would serve as a sign that the work to fulfill the covenants of the Lord has begun (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.1-29#p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Nephi 21:1&#x2013;29</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the time when these things shall be about to take place&#x2014;that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them my Zion;</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign&#x2014;for verily I say unto you that when these things which I declare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be scattered by them;</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these things shall be made known unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father, from them unto you;</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be wrought among you hereafter shall come forth from the Gentiles, unto your seed which shall dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity;</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the Gentiles, that he may show forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and know of the true points of my doctrine, that they may be numbered among my people, O house of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And when these things come to pass that thy seed shall begin to know these things&#x2014;it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who are of the house of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For in that day, for my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall be a great and a marvelous work among them; and there shall be among them those who will not believe it, although a man shall declare it unto them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be cut off from among my people who are of the covenant.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds;</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers;</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hands;</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>For it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that at that day whosoever will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will I cut off from among my people, O house of Israel;</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inheritance;</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and also as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also will be in the midst.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Yea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go out in haste, nor go by flight, for I will go before them, saith the Father, and I will be their rearward.</p></div>
