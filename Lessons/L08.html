<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>Moroni</span><span> concluded the Title Page of the Book of Mormon by inviting us to &quot;condemn not the&#xA0; things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.&quot; The Book of Mormon affirms that all mankind will be resurrected and will be brought to &quot;stand before the judgment-seat of Christ&quot; (</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/3.22#p22" target="_blank"><span>Mormon</span></a><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/3.22#p22" target="_blank"> 3:22</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</p></div></p><div class="callout"><p><strong>22 </strong>And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</p></div>
<p><span>Some people question whether there is life after death. They wonder if their lives have any meaning or whether being good or bad makes any difference. The Book of Mormon teaches that all will be resurrected because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It affirms that we will be judged by our thoughts, words, and works by the perfect judge who is Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span>Elder </span><span>Dallin</span><span> H. Oaks has taught that &quot;</span><span>t</span><span>he assurance of resurrection and immortality affects how we look on the physical challenges of mortality, how we live our mortal lives, and how we relate to those around us.</span></p>
<p><span>&quot;The assurance of resurrection gives us the strength and perspective to endure the <g class="gr_ gr_147 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="147" data-gr-id="147">mortal</g> challenges faced by each of us and by those we love, such things as the physical, mental, or emotional deficiencies we bring with us at birth or acquire during mortal life. Because of the resurrection, we know that these mortal deficiencies are only temporary!&quot; (</span><span><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/04/resurrection?lang=eng">Resurrection</a>&#xA0;Ensign, May 2000).</span></p>
<p><span>Knowing that we are accountable to God for our behavior can motivate us to try our best and to repent of our sins. Some people fear the resurrection and judgment, but for the righteous, these doctrines can bring peace and comfort knowing that all of the wrongs of mortality can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Book of Mormon teaches that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ all mankind will be resurrected.</strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>Lehi teaches his son Jacob that Christ is the </span><span>first fruits</span><span> of the resurrection (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8-10#p8" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:8&#x2013;10</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement&#x2014;</p></div></li>
<li><span>Jacob </span><span>teaches that through the power of the resurrection, the spirits and bodies of men will be restored one to another (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.4-12#p4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9:4&#x2013;12</a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>4 </strong>For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement&#x2014;save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li><span>Amulek</span><span> confounds </span><span>Zeezrom</span><span> and teaches that in the resurrection the spirit and body will be reunited (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.40-46#p40" target="_blank">Alma 11:40&#x2013;46</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>40 </strong>And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</p>
<p><strong>41 </strong>Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</p>
<p><strong>42 </strong>Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</p>
<p><strong>43 </strong>The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</p>
<p><strong>44 </strong>Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</p>
<p><strong>45 </strong>Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.</p>
<p><strong>46 </strong>Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Alma teaches his son </span><span>Corianton</span><span> concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.1-26#p1" target="_blank">Alma 40:1&#x2013;26</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection&#x2014;or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption&#x2014;until after the coming of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know&#x2014;that is concerning the resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead. Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case&#x2014;that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection&#x2014;Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil&#x2014;for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house&#x2014;and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.</p></div></li>
<li>Abinadi teaches the priests of Noah regarding the first resurrection (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.20-26#p20" target="_blank">Mosiah 15:20&#x2013;26</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ&#x2014;for so shall he be called.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And little children also have eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the first resurrection.</p></div>
<li>Abinadi teaches that there is a resurrection and that the grave has no victory because of Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.1-11#p1" target="_blank">Mosiah 16:1&#x2013;11</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall confess before God that his judgments are just.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state.</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation&#x2014;</p></div>
<li><span>Aaron teaches king </span><span>Lamoni&#x2019;s</span><span> father that Christ </span><span>breaketh</span><span> the bands of death (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.13-14#p13" target="_blank">Alma 22:13&#x2013;14</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>13 </strong>And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.</p></div></li>
<li><span>Samuel the </span><span>Lamanite</span><span> teaches that Christ must die to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.14-17,25#p14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Helaman</span><span> 14: 14&#x2013;17, 25</span></a></span><div class="callout"><p><strong>14 </strong>And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of his death.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death&#x2014;that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.</p></div><span>).</span></li>
<li>In his final words, Mormon testifies that Christ has swallowed up the sting of death (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.5-10#p5" target="_blank">Mormon 7:5&#x2013;10</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>5 </strong>Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe that; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye believe this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among them.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first with water, then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the example of our Savior, according to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.</p></div>

<p><strong>21 </strong>I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.</p></div><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">).</span></li>
<li>Alma teaches Zeezrom that we will be judged by our thoughts, words, and deeds (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.8-18#p8" target="_blank">Alma 12:8&#x2013;18</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>8 </strong>And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God&#x2019;s justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.</p></div>
<li>Jacob teaches that following the resurrection all mankind will be judged according to the holy judgments of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.7-15,22,46#p7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Nephi 9:7&#x2013;15, 22, 46</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement&#x2014;save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.</p>
<p><strong>46 </strong>Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice shall be administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty&#x2014;but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.</p></div>
<li>Nephi reminds all mankind that we will be judged on all our doings (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.20-21#p20" target="_blank">1 Nephi 10:20&#x2013;21</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be brought into judgment.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.</p></div>
<li>Nephi teaches that those in the last days who have been deceived by Satan will be judged by their works (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.23#p23" target="_blank">2 Nephi 28:23</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</p></div>
<li>King Benjamin teaches that the wicked will be judged by their works and be consigned to an awful view of their guilt and abominations (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.23-26#p23" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:23&#x2013;26</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>23 </strong>And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.</p></div>
<li>The Lord permits the slaying of righteous Nephites so that the judgments of God upon the wicked will be just (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.11#p11" target="_blank">Alma 14:11</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>11 </strong>But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</p></div>
<li><span>Alma teaches his son </span><span>Corianton</span><span> that those who are righteous will be restored to that which is good (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.1-15#p1" target="_blank">Alma 41:1&#x2013;15</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame&#x2014;mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption&#x2014;raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish&#x2014;good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.</p></div></li>

<p><strong>26 </strong>And behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore out of the books which shall be written shall the world be judged.</p>

<h4>The Strengthening and Enabling Power of the Atonement</h4>
<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p><span>One of the purposes of the Book of Mormon is to show unto the house of Israel &quot;what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers&quot; (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng" target="_blank">title page</a>). These &quot;great things&quot; include the divine assistance, strength, and tender mercies that individuals receive through the strengthening and enabling <g class="gr_ gr_174 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="174" data-gr-id="174">power</g> of Jesus Christ. In the first chapter of his record, Nephi affirmed that one of his purposes was to show &quot;that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom [God] hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance&quot; (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.20#p20" target="_blank">1 Nephi 1:20</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>20 </strong>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</p></div><div class="callout"></div></p>
<p><span>Throughout the Book of Mormon, </span><span>people </span><span>are made mighty or strengthened in order to keep the commandments of God, to overcome challenges and opposition, and to prevail over their fallen nature to become saints. Numerous examples demonstrate the futility of trusting in the arm of flesh and the power afforded to those who trust in the Lord. Through faith in the Savior and His Atonement, </span><span>people </span><span>are enabled to accomplish tasks that are far beyond their natural ability to complete. As we face trials trusting in the Lord, he provides the spiritual gifts necessary for us to both learn from and triumph over our challenges. </span><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>The Book of Mormon demonstrates how we can receive the strengthening and enabling <g class="gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="165" data-gr-id="165">power</g> of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in our lives today. As we face our own trials and challenges with faith in the Lord, He can provide the strength and assistance we need to successfully complete our life&#x2019;s work and become real Latter-day Saints</span><span>.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Scriptural Outline</strong></h5>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">The Book of Mormon teaches that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can be strengthened and enabled to put off the natural man and to become saints.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li>King Benjamin recounts the teachings of an angel concerning the Atonement of Jesus Christ (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19#p19" target="_blank">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>19 </strong>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p></div>
<li><span>Nephi </span><span>laments yielding to temptation and pleads for the Lord&#x2019;s strength and assistance to keep the commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.27-35#p27" target="_blank">2 Nephi 4:27&#x2013;35</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>27 </strong>And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.</p>
<p><strong>30 </strong>Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p><strong>31 </strong>O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?</p>
<p><strong>32 </strong>May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!</p>
<p><strong>33 </strong>O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way&#x2014;but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.</p>
<p><strong>34 </strong>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.</p>
<p><strong>35 </strong>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">We </span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">can be strengthened and enabled to keep the Lord&#x2019;s commandments with His divine assistance</span><span style="text-indent: 1.25em;">.</span></strong></li>
<ol>
<li><span>After </span><span>learning of the Lord&#x2019;s commandment to obtain the brass plates from Laban, Nephi testified that the Lord always provides means to fulfill his commandments (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7#p7" target="_blank">1 Nephi 3:7</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p></div></li>
<li><span>The </span><span>Lord nourishes, strengthens, and provides means for Nephi and his family to travel in the wilderness towards the promised land (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.1-4#p1" target="_blank">1 Nephi 17:1&#x2013;4</a>).</span><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time forth. And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even eight years in the wilderness.</p></div></li>
<li>Nephi is commanded to build a ship to sail to the promised land. The Lord enables him to complete the ship with exceedingly fine workmanship (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.7-15#p7" target="_blank">1 Nephi 17:7&#x2013;15</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.1-4#p1" target="_blank">18:1&#x2013;4</a>).</li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.</p>
<p><strong>4 </strong>And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship, according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was good, and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>7 </strong>And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: I will make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;</p>

<li>Through faith in the Lord, the 2,000 stripling warriors obey with exactness during a battle with the Lamanites.

<p><strong>47 </strong>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</p>
<p><strong>48 </strong>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.</p>
<p><strong>49 </strong>And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.</p>
<p><strong>50 </strong>The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.</p>
<p><strong>51 </strong>For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march&#x2014;therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>52 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.</p>
<p><strong>53 </strong>Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.</p>
<p><strong>54 </strong>And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.</p>
<p><strong>55 </strong>And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.</p>
<p><strong>56 </strong>But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.</p></div><div class="callout"><p><strong>18 </strong>And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe&#x2014;that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.</p></div>

<p><strong>15 </strong>Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith. And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>16 </strong>Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>17 </strong>And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.</p>
<p><strong>18 </strong>And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing.</p>
<p><strong>19 </strong>And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.</p>
<p><strong>20 </strong>And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>21 </strong>And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?</p>
<p><strong>22 </strong>And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.</p>
<p><strong>23 </strong>And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.</p>
<p><strong>24 </strong>And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.</p>
<p><strong>25 </strong>And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.</p>
<p><strong>26 </strong>And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.</p>
<p><strong>27 </strong>And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.</p>
<p><strong>28 </strong>And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.</p>
<p><strong>29 </strong>Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.</p></div><span>).</span></li>

<p><strong>15 </strong>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>28 </strong>Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say&#x2014;We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.</p>

<p><strong>30 </strong>O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.</p>

<p><strong>38 </strong>And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.

And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.</p>
<p><strong>7 </strong>And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of their land.</p>
<p><strong>8 </strong>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and slew many of them.</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren.</p>
<p><strong>10 </strong>Now there were a great many widows in the land, and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them.</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi.</p>
<p><strong>13 </strong>And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the desires of their enemies.</p>
<p><strong>14 </strong>And they did humble themselves even in the depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out of their afflictions.</p>
<p><strong>15 </strong>And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.</p></div></li><div class="callout"><p><strong>1 </strong>And it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.</p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began again to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they began to come into the borders of the land round about.</p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>Now they durst not slay them, because of the oath which their king had made unto Limhi; but they would smite them on their cheeks, and exercise authority over them; and began to put heavy burdens upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb ass&#x2014;</p>
